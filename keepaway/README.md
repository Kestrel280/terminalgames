Controls: Arrow keys, ENTER

If the game does not render, the terminal window may be too small. Try zooming out and increasing the size of the terminal.

There is a Red Guy ('#') trying to make it from the start of a grid to the end. Control the Player ('P') using the arrow keys and place ENTER to place down a temporary barricade to block the Red Guy's path\*, which is visualized using dots. You have a limited number of barricades, and they only last so long; try to keep the Red Guy from reaching the end for as long as possible.

\* Be careful -- you can't place a barricade in a spot that would completely block the Red Guy from reaching the exit! He must always have a valid path to reach the goal.
