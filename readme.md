Each subfolder contains a small, terminal based game written in C and using ncurses to render "graphics" to the terminal.

The purpose of these games is purely for programming practice: projects are supposed to be small and completeable in 1-3 days. Each game deliberately has a minimal set of features, to avoid spending too much time on any one thing (I want to focus more on reps than on polish!). Each game has its own readme with more information.
